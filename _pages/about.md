## Hi!

I am **Juan Marcelo Gutierrez Carballo** (Juan), a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Michael Shin](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/michael_eonsuk_shin/index.php).

I received my B.S. degree at West Texas A&M University, was in the dean's list and graduated with honors.

I am focused on advancing *adaptable software architectures* within the field of software engineering. My research emphasizes designing solutions that dynamically address evolving requirements, allowing systems to *adapt seamlessly* to changes in *security, functionality, and other critical areas*. By leveraging state-machine-driven methods, my work seeks to reduce architectural complexity by managing adaptation and other concerns separately from core application logic.

You can read my full CV [here](/files/JuanMgcPhdCV.pdf), or find me on Google Scholar via this [link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wN_VhAoAAAAJ&hl=en)
